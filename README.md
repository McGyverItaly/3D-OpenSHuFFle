# 3D-OpenTOOLS v1.7-beta
3D-OpenTOOLS is an OpenEuphoria Win32 utility that creates complex OpenSCAD polyhedra (i.e. "polygon mesh", https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh) from a text file

Installation and use:

1a) Install Euphoria 3.1.1 Win32+Dos (e31setup.exe file included, or download it from http://www.rapideuphoria.com/v20.htm), then put 3D-OpenTOOLS_17.exw into a directory with Win32lib.ew v0.59.1 (8/June/2003) and utils.e, finally double-click on 3D-OpenTOOLS_16.exw file. The installation takes only 9 MBytes.

Otherwise:

1b) Double-click on 3D-OpenTOOLS_17.exe (don't need any installation).

2) Once opened, click on menu "?", then on the "Read Me First" item.

3) Follow the instructions to generate a mesh (cube, cylinder or torus).

4) Save it on disk with the "Save Abs. Main Sequence" Button.

5) Load it with the "Main Input file" button.

6) Press "Main+Mod. Sequence to Polyhedron": an OpenSCAD file will now be generated.

5) Check the resulting file(s) in OpenSCAD. If it is already installed, simply double-click on it. If you edit the same file several times, OpenSCAD may require you to press F4+F5 (reload and update), depending on the configuration.

6) Other functions are described in the Documentation.pdf file. In particular, you can start directly from a text file for mesh generation.

Various examples are provided to test the application and get an idea of its potential..
